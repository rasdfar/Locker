# Locker
Project I made on my freetime for practice with c# on Visual Studio. Inspired by these(http://errorcode401.blogspot.fi/2013/06/folder-locker.html) batch scripts. My goal was to make users password more secure. I am not working on it anymore. Maiby I will continue on it some day who knows. Can be used on USB drives to lock files under password atleast from the windows users. Not hack prove :D.More info on "Form1.cs" file.
